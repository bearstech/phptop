- Limit URI column width
- HTML output mode
- Allow many -s options to generate multiple reports in one pass
  (very useful with HTML mode, eg. generate a full report every hour)
- Handle gzipped logs (easy, but useful ?)
- Handle log from stdin (easy, but useful ?)
- Use 'tac' to parse logs if available (faster)
