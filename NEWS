phptop 0.5.9 - 2020-10-22

    * PHP<5.6 compat: skip using ** for exponentiation

phptop 0.5.8 - 2020-10-07

    * More explicit warnings about parsed vs. selected phptop records
    * More robust parsing with FPM vs. Fcgid vs. mod_php

phptop 0.5.7 - 2019-11-26

    * Better formating/alignement (URL at the end), easier to read and compare
    * Memory show as MB instead of bytes
    * Tested with PHP 7.0
    * Debian 9 Stretch support (SAPIs: apache2, cgi, fpm)

phptop 0.5.6 - 2015-10-19

    * Fixed --help with missing --goto option
    * Added -d|--domain option
    * Fixed log parsing with Apache >= 2.4

phptop 0.5.5 - 2014-04-02

    * Added -g|--goto DATE option
    * Now using File::Readbackwards Perl module instead of calling 'tac'
    * Supports gzipped log files - might be slower because it has to fallback
      on forward parsing

phptop 0.5.4 - 2011-08-12

    * Improved man page, mentionned error log problems and CLI not being
      monitored
    * Added -r|--relative option
    * Added -a|--average option

phptop 0.5.3 - 2011-03-14

    * Non-compatible change: -t is now using seconds, because it didn't make
      any sense to use minutes there and seconds here.
    * Minor bugfix, PHP comments use ; and not # now
    * Style fix: 'perlcritic phptop' OK
    * Added 2011 in various (c) notices
    * man page: finally writen the INTERPRETATION section

phptop 0.5.2 - 2010-10-19

    * New man page, lots of details.

phptop 0.5.1 - 2010-03-23

    * Added NEWS to debian/docs, Debian people could only see a rather
      boring 'upstream update' short message (Duck, bug #7).
    * Fixed memory output as a %g float and using sometimes scientific
      notation which would then discard the whole sample once parsed
      (Duck, bug #8).

phptop 0.5 - 2010-03-19

    * New -o|--output-mode option, refactored reporting internally
    * New HTML output support
    * Text output: showing sorting column with '>' on text output
    * Text output: multiple reports are globally column aligned
    * Now checking that -t <value> is numeric
    * Now checking that -s <key> uses a known key
    * Changes -s usage: now using multiple -s instead comma-list
    * Fixed sorting which was not reliable (use proper <=> numeric comparison
      operator)
    * Using exactly one print per line (better buffering for large outputs
      or slow links)
    * Gave up 'inc' measure and display; it could be seen as a code complexity
      measure but has been merely useless in production use for the last months

phptop 0.4.1 - 2009-11-21

    * Now terminal size aware, overridable with COLUMNS env var

phptop 0.4 - 2009-11-14

    * Added reverse parsing based on 'tac', way faster on heavy logs
    * Showing time span in the 'Total' line, more explicit reporting

phptop 0.3.1 - 2009-11-13

    * Be more robust about parsing values, only keep numeric ones
    * hook: don't output \n, it's sometimes escaped back to '\n' in error.log

phptop 0.3 - 2009-11-13

    * Fixed an awful bug about timespan being 12x less than necessary
    * Refactored code with functions and less globals
    * Changed default time span from 1h to 10min
    * Reordered parsing regexes for more logical and faster result
    * Now -s accepts mutiple keys and output one report per sort key

phptop 0.2.2 - 2009-11-06

    * Fixed per URL hit counter, was totally bogus (over-estimated)
    * More strict log checking with 5 mandatory key:value pairs
      (PHP or Apache seem to wrap single input strint to multiple log
       lines sometimes)
    * Reject whole record if a single key/value pair is bogus
    * Warn if more than 5% bogus records found (I see rhoughy 0.2% on
      very busy servers)
    * More elegant global hits/sample counter
    * phptop_hook: switching to explicit formating and locale-independent
      %F formater - hoping it will help with the log wrapping

phptop 0.2.1 - 2009-11-05

    * Don't run hook in CLI mode, it pollutes stderr and makes cronjobs noisy 

phptop 0.2 - 2009-10-20

    * Warn if no logfile is found (and fails)
    * Warn if no record is found (not an error)
    * Added -p|--path-only option
    * Doc fix: >>php.ini instead of >php.ini overwriting
    * Exception fix on untested $_SERVER['HTTPS'] existence (thanks E. Mazurier)

phptop 0.1 - 2009-10-14

    * Initial release
