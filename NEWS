phptop 0.3 - unreleased

	* Fixed per URL hit counter, was totally bogus (over-estimated)
    * More strict log checking with 5 mandatory key:value pairs
      (PHP or Apache seem to wrap single input strint to multiple log
       lines sometimes)
    * More elegant global hits/sample counter

phptop 0.2.1 - 2009-11-05

	* Don't run hook in CLI mode, it pollutes stderr and makes cronjobs noisy 

phptop 0.2 - 2009-10-20

	* Warn if no logfile is found (and fails)
	* Warn if no record is found (not an error)
	* Added -p|--path-only option
	* Doc fix: >>php.ini instead of >php.ini overwriting
	* Exception fix on untested $_SERVER['HTTPS'] existence (thanks E. Mazurier)
